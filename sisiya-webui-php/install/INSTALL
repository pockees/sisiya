This file helps you to create the SisIYA database and populate it
with initial data.

1) Decide which database system you are going to use. There are two 
   possible choices at the momemnt: MySQL and PostgreSQL. When you
   have made your choice, set the DBTYPE variable in the Makefile and 
   according to your needs edit the corresponding db_MySQL.conf or db_PostgreSQL.conf 
   files. What you will probably need to change is the following :
	dbserver 	: The server name or IP address of your database system. 
	dbauser  	: The database administrator's user name. Usually this
			  is mysql for MySQL and postgres for PostgreSQL database systems.
	dbapassword	: This is the password of the dbauser.
	dbadbname	: This is the database name of the dbauser. Usually this is
			  mysql for MySQL and template1 for PostgreSQL.
	dbpassword	: The password of the SisIYA database user (dbuser=sisiya).
2) Edit the populate_db.sql. Here you will need to change the entries for
   locations (When you have more then one server room or server center, you may
   want to see your systems grouped by their location. This table defines the possible
   locations.) and systems (Here you specify your systems: servers, etc.) tables.   
3) Type make to do all the installation. If the entries in the conf file are correctly
   entered or the connection data is correct, then you are going to be prompted
   for dbauser's password.
