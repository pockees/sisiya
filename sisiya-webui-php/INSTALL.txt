1) Database configuration:
	- cd install
	-  Decide which database system you are going to use. There are two 
		possible choices at the momemnt: MySQL and PostgreSQL. When you
		have made your choice, set the DBTYPE variable in the Makefile and 
		according to your needs edit the corresponding db_MySQL.conf or db_PostgreSQL.conf 
		files. What you will probably need to change is the following :
			dbserver 	: The server name or IP address of your database system. 
			dbauser  	: The database administrator's user name. Usually this
					  is mysql for MySQL and postgres for PostgreSQL database systems.
			dbapassword	: This is the password of the dbauser.
			dbadbname	: This is the database name of the dbauser. Usually this is
					  mysql for MySQL and template1 for PostgreSQL.
			dbpassword	: The password of the SisIYA database user (dbuser=sisiya).
		Edit the Makefile and edit the DBTYPE according to your specific needs.
	- Edit the db_DBTYPE.conf (where DBTYPE is your choice in the previous item) and edit it.
	- Execute the make command. 

2) Web server configuration:
	- For Apache use the sisiya_apache.conf configuration file and put it where the Apache configuration files are located,
		on CentOS it is the /etc/httpd/conf.d. After which edit it according to your specific needs.
	- For Nginx use the sisiya_nginx.conf configuration file. After which edit it according to your specific needs.
3) Web UI configuration:
	- Edit the conf/dbconf.php according to the database configuration you have made in the first item.
	- Edit the conf/sisiya_common_conf.php configuration file.
4) Login with user admin and password sisiyaadmin1




Here is a short description of some files:

Makefile 		: This file is used by make (as always) and is a wrapper around dbscript.
dbscript.sh		: This is a wrapper script for exec_DBTYPE.sh scripts. DBTYPE can be
		  	  MySQL or PostgreSQL.
db_DBTYPE.conf		: These files contain database connection info SQL file names.
exec_DBTYPE.sh		: These are scripts which are called from dbscript.sh for
			  executing varios SQLs.
make_history_archive.sh : This script should be run every night after midnight in order to
			  move all records exept which are for today (after midnight records) 
			  from the systemhistorystatus to the systemhistorystatusall table.
			  This is needed in order to speed up the daily queries.
create_tables.sql	: SQL statements for creating the SisIYA's tables.
drop_tables.sql		: SQL statements for deleting the SisIYA's tables.
populate_db.sql		: SQL statements for populating the SisIYA's tables.
