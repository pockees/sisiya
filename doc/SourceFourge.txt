Project Information:

CVS Server:                cvs.sourceforge.net

Project Administration:

The Project Admin page for your project may be accessed at

Service Availability for New Projects:

The DNS for your project web site may take up to 24 hours to become
active.  Until DNS is active for your project, attempts to access
your project web site will result in 404 errors.  Once DNS is active,
you will see an empty directory index when accessing your project
web site, until you have placed content in your project web space
(remember: project web space is provided solely for use in storing
project-related information; see the Web section of the Project Admin
page for additional details).

Your access to the project shell and CVS servers (including your
new CVS repository, which has already been initialized and is ready
for your first import) are typically available within four hours
from the time when your project was approved.  If after 6 hours
your shell/CVS accounts still do not work, please submit a Support
Request (on the "alexandria" project, see below), so as that we may
look in to the problem.
