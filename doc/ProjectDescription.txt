SisIYA a system monitoring and administration tool is a tool for
monitoring the varios networked systems, such as Linux/UNIX, MacOS X and
Windows servers, network switches, routers and other networked devices.
It is based on the client/server architecture. It has its own protocol
of communication. The idea is to inform the system administrators or
operators about the systems in use, about their current status (INFO, OK, WARNING, ERROR).
Mostly client systems send messages to a central server, who
places them in a database. But, there are also cases where the server self
collects some data from clients. At the same time, there is a web interface
to the data stored in the database system, which show the status of the monitored systems.
The project uses at the moment C, Bash, Java and Php. But I plan to
rewrite the C and Java part of it in C++. The supported DBs at the moment are
MySQL and PostgreSQL.
