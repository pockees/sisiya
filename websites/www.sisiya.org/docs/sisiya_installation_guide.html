<h3>Installing from source</h3>
<p>
In order to install SisIYA from source just get the sources from the
<a href="http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.cgi/sisiya/">Subversion</a>
using the following command :
</p>
<ins><pre>
svn co https://sisiya.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/sisiya sisiya
</pre></ins>
<p>
or form the <a href="/downloads/">Downloads</a> section. 

And give the following commands:
</p>
<ins><pre>
make
make install
</pre></ins>
<p>
<b>make</b> configures and compiles the sources. <b>make install</b> installs them.
The <b>make</b> command does executes the following commands :
</p><ins>
<pre>
cd src/ &amp;&amp; ./bootstrap create &amp;&amp; ./configure make &amp;&amp; cd ..
cd edbc/ &amp;&amp; make clean &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; cd ..
cd sisiya_server/ &amp;&amp; ./bootstrap create &amp;&amp; ./configure &amp;&amp; make clean &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; cd ..
</pre>
</ins><p>
The <b>make install</b> command does executes the following commands :
</p><ins>
<pre> 
cd src/ &amp;&amp; make install &amp;&amp; cd ..
cd sisiya_server &amp;&amp; make install &amp;&amp; cd ..
cd edbc &amp;&amp; make install &amp;&amp; cd ..
</pre></ins>
<p>
At the moment <b>src</b>, <b>sisiya_server</b> and <b>edbc</b> use different configure and make files and options. This is the reason why I need
to configure, compile and install them with seperate commands. On the top level of the source directory there is a Makefile which has the
above commands in one place. Please refere to this Makefile for up-to-date compile information.<br /><br />

<b>./bootsrtap create</b> command initializes the autoconf/automake environment. 
<br />
<b>./configure</b>
configures the sources.
<br />
<b>make</b> compiles the sources and <b>make install</b> installs SisIYA. Install targets accept 
"install_root=/new_root_dir" parameter, so that you can install relative to the new_root_dir. Install scripts are designed
and tested under CentOS 4.2, Fedora Core 4 and RedHat ES4. But I am going to modify them and make them compatible with 
other systems. At least I am going to read the LSB and try to be comformed with it.
If your system is not one of the tested systems, you can modify the corresponding files and run the above commands again.
Or just let me know and I would be very glad to help you.
</p>

<h3>Installing from rpm</h3>
<p>
This is the preferred way of installing SisIYA on Linux. There are different packages to install on:
<ins>
<pre>
sisiya-edbc-libs-&lt;version&gt;.i386.rpm
sisiya-server-&lt;version&gt;.i386.rpm
sisiya-server-checks-&lt;version&gt;.i386.rpm
sisiya-client-checks&lt;version&gt;.i386.rpm
sisiya-client-systems-&lt;version&gt;.i386.rpm
sisiya-dbscripts-&lt;version&gt;.i386.rpm
sisiya-php-&lt;version&gt;.i386.rpm
</pre></ins>
Every package hase its own version, because the development is at different stages for each package. The RPM's spec
file contains the version information.
<b>sisiya-edbc-libs</b> package contains shared libraries used by the <b>sisiyad</b> for database operations. This package
is a database connectivity framework written in C++ and for C++ applications. It is far from a complete framework, but
it meets all requirements that SisIYA needs.
<br />
<b>sisiya-server</b> package contains the <b>sisiyad</b> daemon which recieves messages from the client systems and
records them in the database. This computer must be accessible from all your client systems.
<br />
<b>sisiya-server-checks</b> package contains scripts and programs to check your systems remotely. Therefore you are 
going to need access from this computer to your clients that are going to be checked remotely. Normally I install
this package on the same computer, on which the sisiya-server package is installed. This is also the reason for
the package name. These scripts and programs are used to check your systems and send the results to the <b>sisiyad</b>
server.
<br />
<b>sisiya-client-checks</b> package contains the software for your clients. There are 5 check scripts available with this
package. These are checks for filesystem, swap, system, load and users.  
<br />
<b>sisiya-client-systems</b> package contains your site specific hostname directories, which in turn contain
checks that are special for every system. More on this package later.
<br />
<b>sisiya-dbscripts</b> contains scripts and SQL files to initialize the SisIYA database. Normally you will
need this package only to initialize the SisIYA database. After that you can use the SisIYA's administration
web interface. This package does not have to be installed on the database server. 
<br />
<b>sisiya-php</b> contains the web interface to SisIYA. There is also an administration web interface. These
scripts are written in PHP for Apache. The web interface scripts support PostgreSQL and MySQL databases.
</p>
<h3>Packages to install on the SisIYA server</h3>
<p>
Install 
<ins><pre>
sisiya-edbc-libs
sisiya-server
sisiya-server-checks
sisiya-dbscripts
sisiya-php
</pre></ins> 
on the SisIYA server. The SisIYA server is the computer which is going to be used to monitor your systems. 
Actually you could install all these components on different computers.  
</p>
<h3>Packages to install on your clients</h3>
<p>
Install the following packages
<ins><pre>
sisiya-client-checks
sisiya-client-systems
</pre></ins> 
on your client systems. A client system is computer which is going to be monitored by the SisIYA server. You can also
install these packages on the SisIYA server itsel in order to monitor it.
</p>

<h3>Recommendation</h3>
<p>
I would recommend that you rebuild the <b>sisiya-client-checks</b> and <b>sisiya-client-systems</b> packages
according to your needs. In the <b>sisiya-client-checks</b> package you would need to chanage the hostname for your SisIYA
server, which is specified in the <b>sisiya_client.conf</b> file. The <b>sisiya-client-systems</b> package 
contains directories which are your client systems' hostnames. In these directories you can create soft links 
to the scripts in the  <b>special</b> directory, which comes with the <b>sisiya-client-checks</b> package. And change the
default values for error and warning. 
</p>
<h3>Building SisIYA RPM packages</h3>
<p>
In order to build the SisIYA RPM packages:
<ins>
<ol><li>
Download the SisIYA's source RPM package sisiya-&lt;version&gt;.src.rpm.
</li><li>
Install the source RPM with the rpm -ivh sisiya-&lt;version&gt;.src.rpm.
</li><li>
Build the SisIYA packages with the rpmbuild -ba /path_to_rpm_SPECS_dir/sisiya.spec. Where path_to_rpm_SPECS_dir is where 
your RPM specs files reside. The default is /usr/src/redhat/SPECS.
</li></ol></ins>
You will need a Java SDK installed on your build computer. This is needed to compile the SISIYACheckDB.java program, which
is used to check the database systems.
<br />
It is usefull to build the SisIYA packages and customize them for your needs. You can use the sisiya-&lt;version&gt;.src.rpm package or you can get the SisIYA sources from cvs server. See <a href="sisiya.sourceforge.net">SisIYA</a> homepage
for more information on obtaining the sources. If you would like to use the sisiya-&lt;version&gt;.src.rpm follow the 
following steps:
<ins><ol><li>
Unpackage the source RPM using the following command:
<ins><pre>
 rpm2cpio sisiya-&lt;version&gt;.src.rpm | cpio -i 
</pre></ins>
</li><li>
Next untar the tar.gz file:
<ins><pre>
tar xvfz sisiya-&lt;version&gt;.tar.gz
</pre></ins>
Note: The version here does not contain the release part, which has the source RPM package.
</li><li>
In the sisiya-&lt;version&gt;/src directory there is a script called make_sisiya_source.sh. 
Use this script to generate a custom sisiya-&lt;version&gt;.tar.gz tar file. 
</li><li>
And build the RPM packages with the following command:
<ins><pre>
rpmbuild -ta sisiya-&lt;version&gt;.tar.gz
</pre></ins>
</li></ol></ins>
I would like to explain the customization (step 3) a little bit more:
<ins><ol><li>
Create a directory where you are going to keep your customized files:
<ins><pre>
mkdir sisiya_local_dir
</pre></ins>
</li><li>
Use your favorite editor and create a file called local_confs.conf under the newly created directory:
<ins><pre>
vi sisiya_local_dir/local_confs.conf
</pre></ins>
And enter the following line:
<ins><pre>
sisiya_server=sisiya.example.org
admins_mail=sisiyaadmins@example.org
</pre></ins>
Change the sisiya_server and admins_mail according to your needs. The sisiya_server contains the name or IP address of
the server, where the sisiya-server package is installed. The admins_mail contains the e-mail address or e-mail
addresses separete by a comma. Some SisIYA scripts send e-mails to the SisIYA admin(s) requiring attention of the admin.
</li><li>
If you create the following subdirectories under the sisiya_local_dir and put customized versions of the original
files, they are going to be copied by the make_sisiya_source.sh script to their corresponding directories:
<ins><pre>
db/
sisiya_ui/images/
sisiya_server_checks/
sisiya_check/systems/
</pre></ins>
</li></ol></ins>
</p>
<p>
Customization is an advanced topic which requires in depth knowledge of SisIYA. For more information read the
<a href="./sisiya_administration_guide.html">SisIYA administration guide</a>.
</p>
<h3>Database configuration</h3>
<p>
At the moment SisIYA supports only MySQL and PostgreSQL database systems. The <b>sisiya-dbscripts</b> package
contains scripts for an initial database configuration.  Those scripts help you to create the SisIYA database 
and populate it with initial data. Change into the /opt/sisiya-dbscripts directory.
<ins><ol><li>
Decide which database system you are going to use. There are two
possible choices at the momemnt: MySQL and PostgreSQL. When you
have made your choice, set the DBTYPE variable in the Makefile and
according to your needs edit the corresponding db_MySQL.conf or db_PostgreSQL.conf
files. What you will probably need to change is the following :
<ins><ul><li>
dbserver : The server name or IP address of your database system.
</li><li>
dbauser : The database administrator's user name. Usually this is mysql for MySQL and postgres 
for PostgreSQL database systems.
</li><li>
dbapassword : This is the password of the dbauser.
</li><li>
dbadbname : This is the database name of the dbauser. Usually this is mysql for MySQL and 
template1 for PostgreSQL.
</li><li>
dbpassword : The password of the SisIYA database user (dbuser=sisiya).
</li></ul></ins></li>
<li>
Edit the populate_db.sql. Here you will need to change the entries for
locations (When you have more then one server room or server center, you may
want to see your systems grouped by their location. This table defines the possible
locations.) and systems (Here you specify your systems: servers, etc.) tables.
</li>
<li>Type make to do all the installation. If you have chosen PostgreSQL, then you are going to be prompted for dbauser's 
password.
</li></ol></ins>

Here is a short description of some files in the /opt/sisiya-dbscripts directory:
<ins><ul><li>
Makefile                : This file is used by make (as always) and is a wrapper around dbscript.
</li><li>
dbscript.sh             : This is a wrapper script for exec_DBTYPE.sh scripts. DBTYPE can be
                          MySQL or PostgreSQL.
</li><li>
db_DBTYPE.conf          : These files contain database connection info SQL file names.
</li><li>
exec_DBTYPE.sh          : These are scripts which are called from dbscript.sh for
                          executing varios SQLs.
</li><li>
make_history_archive.sh : This script should be run every night after midnight in order to
                          move all records exept which are for today (after midnight records)
                          from the systemhistorystatus to the systemhistorystatusall table.
                          This is needed in order to speed up the daily queries.
</li><li>
create_tables.sql       : SQL statements for creating the SisIYA's tables.
</li><li>
drop_tables.sql         : SQL statements for deleting the SisIYA's tables.
</li><li>
populate_db.sql         : SQL statements for populating the SisIYA's tables. The password for the admin user is sisiyaadmin1.
</li></ul></ins>
</p>
<h3>SisIYA daemon configuration</h3>
<p>
Use 
<ins><pre>man sisiyad</pre></ins>
and 
<ins><pre>man sisiyad.conf</pre></ins> 
commands to get information about the SisIYA daemon and its configuration file. Don't forget to check and
maybe edit the database related configuration part of the sisiyad.conf file.
</p>
<h3>PHP interface configuration</h3>
<p>
The <b>sisiya-php</b> package installs SisIYA's PHP GUI under the /var/www/html/sisiya directory. There is 
file called dbconf.php. Here you can edit and change values for the following database configuration parameters:
<ins><pre>
$dbType="MySQL";		# valid values are MySQL and PostgreSQL 
$db_server="localhost";		# host name or IP address of the the SisIYA's database
$db_user="sisiyauser";		# the username to connect to the SisIYA's database
$db_password="sisiyauser1";	# database user's password
$db_name="sisiya";		# name of the SisIYA's database
</pre></ins>
If you have installed SisIYA's database using the sisiya-dbscripts package scripts, then you can use the initial
administration user <b>admin</b> with password <b>sisiyaadmin1</b>. After successfully accessing the GUI interface, you
can change the password for this user or generate another admin or general users. The difference between admin
users and general users is that general users do not have all permissions that admin users have. The admin user interface
is accessable through the monitoring interface or directly by specifying sisiya_adm.php. For example: 
<ins><pre>
http://sisiya.example.org/sisiya_adm.php
</pre></ins>
</p>
<h3>Client configuration</h3>
<p>
Clients are configured through the <b>sisiya_client.conf</b> configuration file under the /opt/sisiya_client_checks directory.
This file is installed on every computer, which is going to be monitored by SisIYA. Here is a partially listing of the
sisiya_client.conf file:
<ins><pre>
### SisIYA Server's name or IP address
SISIYA_SERVER=127.0.0.1
### SisIYA server port on which the SisIYA daemon is listenening 
SISIYA_PORT=8888
###
### Field seperator, used to seperate fields in the SisIYA message
SP="~"
##########################################################
sisiya_hostname=`hostname`
sisiya_base_dir="/opt/sisiya_client_checks"
sisiya_bin_dir="${sisiya_base_dir}/bin"
sisiya_host_dir="${sisiya_base_dir}/systems/${sisiya_hostname}"
send_message_prog="${sisiya_bin_dir}/sisiya_send_message.sh"
send_message2_prog="${sisiya_bin_dir}/sisiya_send_message2.sh"
sisiyac_prog="${sisiya_bin_dir}/sisiyac"
sisiya_functions="${sisiya_bin_dir}/sisiya_functions.sh"
### status ids
status_info=0
status_ok=1
status_warning=2
status_error=3
###
### service ids, these IDs must be identical with IDs in the SisIYA database
serviceid_system=0
serviceid_filesystem=1
serviceid_cpu=2
serviceid_swap=3
serviceid_load=4
serviceid_smtp=5
</pre></ins> 
This configuration file is actually a BASH script. This configuration file is included from all SisIYA check scripts.
Therefore, BASH syntax apply to this script.
<b>SISIYA_SERVER</b> is the name or the IP address of the SisIYA server. <b>SISIYA_PORT</b> is the the port number where 
the SisIYA daemon listens on. <b>sisiya_hostname</b> is the name of the system (in this case the name of the client) for
which the checks are performed. The SisIYA daemon checks this name before recording the results of the checks. Therefore,
it must be a name whic also exists in the SisIYA's database. The <b>sisiya_hostname</b> can either be short hostname or
a fully qualified hostname. The value of this parameter (sisiya_hostname) is also used by the <b>sisiya_all.sh</b>
script to locate the host's systems directory under the /opt/sisiya_client_checks/systems directory. Under this directory 
(/opt/sisiya_checks/systems/$sisiya_hostname) are the links to special checks for this system and/or config files
for various scripts. For more info about SisIYA scripts refer to the 
<a href="./sisiya_administration_guide.html">SisIYA Administration Guide</a>. <b>SP</b> is the field seperator used to 
seperate fields in the SisIYA message. <b>sisiya_base_dir</b> is the top level directory where the SisIYA client package
is installed to. <b>sisiya_bin_dir</b> is the directory where SisIYA binaries and scripts reside. <b>sisiya_host_dir</b>
is the directory where the customization conf files and links to the spacial scripts reside. <b>send_message_prog</b>
is a script, which is used to send one SisIYA message at a time to the SisIYA server. <b>send_message2_prog</b> is another
script, which is used to send multiple SisIYA messages to the SisIYA server. Both of these scripts use the 
<b>sisiyac_prog</b> for sending the SisIYA message to the SisIYA server. <b>sisiya_functions</b> is a BASH script,
which contains common functions used in the SisIYA check scripts. <b>status_info</b>, <b>status_ok</b>, 
<b>status_warning</b> and <b>status_error</b> are the all possible status IDs used in SisIYA. You do need to change these
status values, unless you also change them in the database. The rest of the configuration file contains service IDs for
various SisIYA checks. These values must also correspond to those in the SisIYA database.
