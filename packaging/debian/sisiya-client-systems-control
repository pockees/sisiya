Description: The systems directory for SisIYA client programs and checks.
	The systems directory for SisIYA client programs and checks. This package is site dependent.
	In other words, the systems directory contains directories with hostnames, which contain special
	checks and configuration files for that particular host. Every site has its own set of hostnames/checks
	in the systems directory.
